# TODO
(This is my own TODO list for the future)


- Find a license
- Add a tools_parseKnownFonts and add Free fonts + update pssm.Button class accordingly
- Test the performance gain when drawing in batch (with FBInk's no_refresh) when printing a whole layout instead of doing the operation with pillow
- learn more about HW dithering modes
- Handle RGB Image (and use a boolean like screen.is_rgb for instance)
- Handle rotation
- More documentation
- Rewrite my dashboard with PSSM
